I'm Tianyi (I go by Alex). I'm going to be a master student at CU Boulder studying applied math this fall. I majored in pure math in undergrad at the University of Rochester.

I'm passionate about studying and researching statistics and earth environmental system and doing data for good. I'm currently a voluteer Data Scientist at [Model.Earth](https://model.earth/community/) and Data Engineer at [Village Book Builder](https://joinourvillage.org/). I like writing blogs about statistics, math, data science, environmental science, and ideas I daydreamed.

Hobbies: listening to musics and messing with makeups and different fashion choices. Playing video games (OW2 and others) with my partner and friends. Reading and library Hopping. Finding different ways to use my creative energy.

Hope you find something interesting here.
