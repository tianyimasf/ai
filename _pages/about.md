I'm Tianyi (you can call me Alex). I'm going to be a master student at CU Boulder studying applied math this fall. I majored in pure math in undergrad.

I'm passionate about research in the areas of natural language processing and social computing, as well as climate tech. I'm a Climatebase fellow at Climatebase Fellowship Q1 2024. I like writing blogs about my thoughts and projects.

Personally, I like listening to musics and messing with makeups and different fashion choices. I'm always finding new ways to use my creative energy. In my free time I play video games with my partner and friends.

Hope you find something interesting here.
