I'm Tianyi(you can call me Alex.) I'm going to be a master student at CU Boulder studying applied math this fall. I majored in pure math in undergrad and have a few years of natural language processing and combinatorics research experience. I've worked a year as a software engineer at a startip in the bay area after graduating from uni.

I'm passionate about research in the areas of natural language processing and social computing, as well as climate tech. I'm just starting my climate journey and am a Climatebase fellow at Climatebase Fellowship Q1 2024. I also like writing personal and technical blogs about my thoughts and projects.

I like listening to musics and messing with makeups and different fashion choices. Lastly, I spend my free time with my partner and friends playing video games.

Hope you find something interesting here.
