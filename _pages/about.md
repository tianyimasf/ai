I'm Alex(Tianyi), a master student at CU Boulder studying applied math. I have 6 years of AI research experience at two great US universities, my alma mater University of Rochester, and my current school CU Boulder. I have 1.5 years of software engineer/ML experience at Scale AI, a Forbes Top 50 AI startup with 600 employees and 600M+ funding.

I like learning about recent AI developments, working on projects valuable to others, and writing about the technologies I work with. I spend my free time with my partner and friends playing video games.

Hope you find something interesting here.
