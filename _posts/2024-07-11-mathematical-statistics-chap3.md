- X is a **random variable** if: S is a sample space with a probability measure and X is a **real-valued function** defined over the elements of S.

- **Real-valued functions** are functions that take a real number or a vector consisted of real numbers as their input values.

- Random variables denoted by **capital** letters.

- **X = x** is the set of elements in the sample space for which the random variable X has value x.

- The **probability distribution** of a **discrete** random variable X, or **probability mass function**, or **p.m.f.** of X, is: the function given by $f(x) = P(X = x)$ for each x within the range of X.
