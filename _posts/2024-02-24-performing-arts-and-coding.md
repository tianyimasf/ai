If you have coded before but have also done any sort of performing art, you'll notice something that both jobs needs to be able to succeed. And that's the ability to self-direct, or "ownership". I discovered this through my own experience coding, and as a hobbyist singer.

Whenever I try to cover a song using [Smule](https://www.smule.com/), I panick in my first try because I was just "trying to sing". And that's not enough. You need to KNOW how you want it to sound like, and then control your voice to achieve that effect. Whenever I see an artist sing, I never realize that this is the first necessary step to produce a piece. But every artist need to do this whenever they sing, and similarly, every coder has to be able to rely on themselves to write a piece of program. If you always need other people to help you program and have 0 ability or drive to learn and improve, you're never ever going to succeed as a programmer; and if you have to rely on yourself, you need to know how to self-direct, and OWN your code/program. And that's the one essential thing that performing artists and coders have in common, despite how different the job description is.

This might also extend to just any creative jobs.
