From when I was young I'm an indecisive child. In high school, I hesitate between different clubs; in college, I couldn't decide what my major would be until junior year. Even after I graduate, I couldn't decide between industry and academia. I have too many ideas, too many things I want to do, and difficulties choosing one over another. But that's just it, that's just what life is about -- choosing your priorities. 

You can be good at everything. But you can be good at something. (kudos to my friend YY for hitting me with this golden quote!)

Three approaches that helped getting me out of directionlessly touching on everything but not deeply into anything:

1. Start from somewhere. Anywhere. Do the thing that you've been talking about doing for years but wasn't actually doing. You know what I'm talking about. For me, those things are: try implementing a startup idea, and actively start pursuing working on climate change, something that is socially good. Commit to the things you decided to do and prioritize them to ensure you really spend enough time to be able to figure out if you really want to continue doing them or not.
