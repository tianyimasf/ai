title: "Data cleaning and transformation in Python: Analyze LinkedIn Job Postings"
categories: [Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Data Tranformation]
excerpt: Data cleaning and transformation is usually the first step in the data analysis process. For each project's specific purpose, we might find data from multiple different data sources, in different formats, and need to be combined and cleaned so that later when we are analyzing, we have high quality data that is necessary for a good outcome.

Data cleaning and transformation is usually the first step in the data analysis process. For each project's specific purpose, we might find data from multiple different data sources, in different formats, and need to be combined and cleaned so that later when we are analyzing, we have high quality data that is necessary for a good outcome.

Since real life data are so messy, the data preparation steps are usually different from project to project. In this blog, we look at a specific application: analyzing LinkedIn job postings, especially jobs related to Data/AI. We'll look at the data cleaning and transformations we need to do, and in future blogs talks about further analysis. [The google colab for this is here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X-l681ONO4KBlak7Pf4-JfGUloOP1549?usp=sharing). Feel free to make a copy, download the data, and play around with the code.

Now let's look at the data sources we got.
