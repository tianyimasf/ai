- If there are N equally likely possibilities, of which one must occur and n are regarded as favorable, or as a “success”, then the probability of a “success” is given by the ratio $ \frac{n}{N} $.

- **Experiment**: Any process of observation or measurement.

- **Outcomes**: The results one obtains from an experiment. (Ex. sensor readings, value counts, “yes”, or “no” answers)

- **Sample space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment, denoted by $S$.

- **Element/Sample Point**: Each outcome in a sample space.

- **Discrete sample space**: A sample space that contains either a finite or a countable number of distinct sample points.

- **Event**: A subset of a sample space.
