- If there are N equally likely possibilities, of which one must occur and n are regarded as favorable, or as a “success”, then the probability of a “success” is given by the ratio $ \frac{n}{N} $.

- **Experiment**: Any process of observation or measurement.

- **Outcomes**: The results one obtains from an experiment. (Ex. sensor readings, value counts, “yes”, or “no” answers)

- **Sample space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment, denoted by $S$.

- **Element/Sample Point**: Each outcome in a sample space.

- **Discrete sample space**: A sample space that contains either a finite or a countable number of distinct sample points.

- **Event**: A subset of a sample space.

- **Union $A \cup B$**: the subset of S that contains all the elements that are either in A or in B, or in both.

- **Intersection $A \cap B$**: the subset of S that contains all the elements that are both in A and B.

- **Complement $A'$ of $A$**: the subset of S that contains all the elements of S that are not in A.

- Events A and B are **mutually exclusive** if $A \cap B = \emptyset$ (A and B doesn't occur at the same time).

- A is **contained** in B is written as $A \subset B$.
